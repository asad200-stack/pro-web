## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Internationalization**: Custom language switcher with RTL support
- **Deployment**: Railway-ready configuration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database
- Railway account (for deployment)

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd multi-store-saas-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/multistore_db?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
NODE_ENV="development"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Important**: Generate a strong random string for `JWT_SECRET`. You can use:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 4. Set Up Database

Make sure PostgreSQL is running, then:

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npm run db:generate

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Or push schema directly (for development)
npm run db:push
```

### 5. Create Uploads Directory

```bash
mkdir -p public/uploads
```

### 6. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Creating Your First Store

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/register`
2. Fill in your details:
   - Your name
   - Email address
   - Password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Store name
   - Store URL slug (optional)
3. Click "Create Account"
4. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the admin dashboard

## Admin Dashboard Access

- **Store Owner**: `/admin` - Manage your store, products, and settings
- **Super Admin**: `/admin` - Manage all stores and platform settings

## Public Store Access

Each store has a public URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/store/[store-slug]
```

Example:
```
http://localhost:3000/store/my-awesome-store
```

## Railway Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure all your code is committed and pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Railway Project

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect Next.js

### 3. Set Up PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will create a PostgreSQL database
4. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` from the database service

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=<your-railway-postgres-url>
JWT_SECRET=<generate-a-strong-random-string>
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

**Generate JWT_SECRET**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

After deployment, you need to run database migrations. You can do this via Railway's CLI or by adding a one-time command:

1. In Railway, go to your service
2. Click "Settings" → "Deploy"
3. Add a "Deploy Command" (optional, or run manually):
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy && npm start
   ```

Or use Railway CLI:
```bash
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 6. Build and Deploy

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect your Next.js project
2. Install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Start the application with `npm start`

### 7. Verify Deployment

1. Check Railway logs for any errors
2. Visit your Railway app URL
3. Test registration and login
4. Verify database connection

## Database Migrations

### Development

```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run db:migrate

# Apply migrations
npm run db:push
```

### Production (Railway)

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or via Railway dashboard terminal
npx prisma migrate deploy
```
